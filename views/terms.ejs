    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Hip Hop Grammar, a music curation service by illegible.ink, powered by Spotify. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Hip Hop Grammar, including browsing, purchasing, and saving curated hip hop playlists to your Spotify account. By using our service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h3>1. Service Overview</h3>
    <p>Hip Hop Grammar provides expertly curated hip hop playlist sets, created by illegible.ink, for use with your Spotify account. Free playlist sets are available to all users, while premium sets can be unlocked for a one-time curation fee (starting at $5 per set) via Stripe. Once unlocked, you can save these playlists to your Spotify library using the "+", "Save to Spotify", feature.</p>

    <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
    <p>You must have a valid Spotify account to use Hip Hop Grammar. By accessing our service, you represent that you are at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) and have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h3>3. Spotify Integration</h3>
    <p>Hip Hop Grammar uses Spotify’s API to authenticate your account and save playlists to your Spotify library. You must log in with your Spotify credentials, granting us permission to access your account as outlined during authentication. We do not store your Spotify login details, only the access tokens required to perform these actions on your behalf.</p>

    <h3>4. Payments</h3>
    <p>Premium playlist sets require a one-time curation fee, processed securely through Stripe. Fees are non-refundable once a set is unlocked, except as required by law. Pricing is displayed in USD and may vary by set (e.g., $5 or higher). You are responsible for any additional taxes or fees imposed by your payment provider.</p>

    <h3>5. User Conduct</h3>
    <p>You agree not to misuse Hip Hop Grammar, including attempting to reverse-engineer, distribute, or resell our curated playlists without permission. Violation of these Terms may result in termination of your access to the service.</p>

    <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>The curation and presentation of playlist sets are owned by illegible.ink. Music content is provided via Spotify and subject to Spotify’s terms and artist licensing agreements. You may not claim ownership of curated playlists beyond personal use in your Spotify library.</p>

    <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>Hip Hop Grammar is provided "as is." illegible.ink is not liable for interruptions, errors, or damages arising from your use of the service or Spotify’s platform, except where prohibited by law. We do not guarantee playlist availability if Spotify removes tracks or restricts API access.</p>

    <h3>8. Termination</h3>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to Hip Hop Grammar for violating these Terms or at our discretion. You can stop using the service at any time by logging out and deleting saved playlists from Spotify.</p>

    <h3>9. Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>We may update these Terms periodically. Continued use of Hip Hop Grammar after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. Check this page for the latest version.</p>
